          </h1>
          <p className="text-xl text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            I'm a passionate 3D creator specializing in bringing digital designs to life through modeling and printing. 
            My work spans from intricate artistic pieces to functional mechanical parts, always pushing the boundaries 
            of what's possible with modern fabrication technology.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              My fascination with 3D creation began when I first discovered the intersection of digital design 
              and physical manufacturing. The ability to conceptualize an idea, model it in software, and then 
              hold the tangible result in my hands sparked a passion that continues to drive my work today.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Over the years, I've honed my skills across various aspects of the 3D creation pipelineâ€”from 
              mastering CAD software and understanding material properties to perfecting post-processing 
              techniques. Each project presents unique challenges that push me to learn and innovate.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Whether it's designing functional mechanical components, creating artistic sculptures, or 
              prototyping new product ideas, I approach every project with attention to detail and a 
              commitment to quality craftsmanship.
